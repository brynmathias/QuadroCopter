QuadroCopter
============

Software for quadrocopter

Currently requires OpenCV (open computer vision from Intel)

Learning folder contains the code that I am learning to use Open CV with.
Currently takes an image with the webcam, converts it to grey scale, runs some edge detection and chops the image up.

plan: take two images, cut in to slices and match them - useful for distance measurement
